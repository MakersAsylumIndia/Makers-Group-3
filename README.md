# 📘 Project Unmute: A Sign Language to Speech Glove

**Oorjit Sethi, Rabani Kohli, Advit Agrawal**

**Problem Statement**

Millions of people worldwide rely on sign language to communicate, but many others do not understand it, creating a significant barrier between the Deaf and hearing communities. This communication gap affects everyday interactions, access to services, and full participation in society for sign language users.

**Our Solution**

We are developing a **sign language converting glove**—a wearable device equipped with sensors that detect hand and finger movements associated with sign language gestures. These movements are then translated in real-time into spoken or written language via a connected app or interface. This glove aims to facilitate smoother, faster, and more inclusive communication between sign language users and non-signers.


**Hardware Used**

**🧤 Glove Assembly**

-Pair of Synthetic Gloves
-Fevibond (for attaching sensors)
-3D Printer (for custom mounting parts)

**📏 Sensors**

-5x Flex Sensors – Detect finger bending
-MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyroscope – Detect hand motion and orientation

**🔌 Electronics & Microcontroller**

-ESP32 – Main microcontroller with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth
-General-Purpose (GP) Board – For sensor connections and mounting
-Jumper Wires – For wiring the components
-Soldering Iron – To secure electrical connections


**Software Used**


1) Arduino IDE	Used for reading sensor data from flex sensors and MPU6050 via ESP32

2) Visual Studio Code	Main development environment for all Python-based components:
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
- Neural Networks (TensorFlow, Keras)
- Web Application (Flask)
- Database Interaction (SQLite / MySQL)
